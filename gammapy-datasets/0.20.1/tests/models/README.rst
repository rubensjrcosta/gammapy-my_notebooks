Models
======

This folder contains a few models in XML (and soon YAML) format,
for testing of Gammapy model serialisation.

Format and code not stable.
Feel free to change or add new models!

* `shell.xml` -- taken from ctools test files
* `ctadc_skymodel_gps_sources_bright.xml` -- very preliminary version of
  Galactic sky model for CTA data challenge, with sources from gamma-cat.
* `fermi_model.xml` -- Fermi model with galactic IEM and diffuse template
