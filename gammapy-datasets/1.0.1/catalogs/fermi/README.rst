Fermi catalogs
==============

This is a copy of the Fermi-LAT catalogs.

We'd like to use those for tests and examples in Gammapy,
and had lots of timeouts downloading those from the FSSC server.

So while this is non-ideal, we're bundling a copy af the
FITS catalog files here to make this more reliable.
