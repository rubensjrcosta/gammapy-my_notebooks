# MAGIC observations with RAD_MAX table 

The two MAGIC observations in this directory provide point-like IRF components with [an energy-dependent directional cut](https://gamma-astro-data-formats.readthedocs.io/en/latest/irfs/point_like/#rad-max-2d).

They are released with the approval of the MAGIC software board to ease the implementation of the energy-dependent spectrum extraction in Gammapy.

The two runs are a reprocessed version of the two publicly released for the [joint-crab project](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...625A..10N/abstract), then produced with fixed cuts.

These data are preliminary and might be updated following future updates in the the MAGIC DL3 converter.
