HESS data files
===============

Here's some files exported by the HESS software to test if they can be read OK by Gammapy.

Note that they don't contain any internal information or useful data, e.g. the
event list contains just a few gamma-like background events.

I'm doing this because faking all the info (header keywords and columns) would
be more work than implementing the data classes themselves...
